Certainly! Here's a simple description of a new GitHub repository for an online book reader app using C++ and object-oriented programming (OOP):

Repository Name: C++ Online Book Reader App

# Description:
The C++ Online Book Reader App is a console-based application that allows users to read and manage books in an online library. It is built using C++ and follows the principles of object-oriented programming (OOP) for organizing and managing the codebase.

# Features:

Book Catalog: Users can view a catalog of available books in the online library. Each book contains information such as title, author, genre, and publication year.

Book Search: Users can search for books based on different criteria, such as title, author, or genre. The app provides a search functionality to help users find specific books of interest.

Book Reading: Users can choose a book from the catalog and read it within the application. The app provides a user-friendly interface for navigating through the book, such as moving between chapters or pages.

Book Management: Users can add new books to the library or remove existing books. The app allows for the addition, deletion, and modification of book information, such as updating the title, author, or genre.

User Accounts: The app supports user accounts, allowing users to create and manage their own profiles. Each user can have their own personalized book catalog and reading history.

# Techniques Used:

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): The app follows OOP principles to organize the codebase into classes and objects, promoting code reusability, encapsulation, and modularity.
